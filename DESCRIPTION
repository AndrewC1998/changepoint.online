Description: Sequential methods for online detection of changepoints in
    univariate time series. Extends the 'changepoint' package by
    decomposing offline routines into separate initialise and update
    steps, enabling real-time monitoring using PELT-based cost functions,
    ARL-calibrated penalties and nonparametric 'ecp'-based statistics.
    Developed as part of Google Summer of Code 2018.
